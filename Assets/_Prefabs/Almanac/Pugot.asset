  creatureName: Pugot
  creatureDescription: The Pugot is a headless creature that can detach its head
    without dying. It is often depicted as a black, gigantic being that usually resides
    in trees. The Pugot is known to morph into a dog, a boar, or a huge pheasant,
    and it can move at great speeds, feeding on snakes and insects it finds among
    the trees. This creature has a mischievous side, as it likes to scare people
    by showing up without its head, leaving the exposed stump of its neck bubbling
    with blood. Additionally, the Pugot is known for its fondness for women's underwear
    and will steal them while they are being dried on a clothesline.
