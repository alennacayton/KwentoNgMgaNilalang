  creatureName: Bungisngis
  creatureDescription: The Bungisngis is a mythical creature in Filipino folklore
    that is often described as a large, strong man who is always laughing. It has
    a thick, protruding upper lip that it can use to cover the top of its head like
    a hat and has superb hearing. It is said to dwell in the forests and has a voracious
    appetite for anything palatable, including animals, fruits, vegetables, roots,
    and cooked food. Despite its strength, the Bungisngis is easily outwitted and
    quickly panics.
